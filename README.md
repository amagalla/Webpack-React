Webpack has been updated. Tested and is fully deployable when added with a server. <br /><br />
dist folder appears with all minified files for deployment.

npm install <br />
npm run build (for deployment or to run server side) <br />
npm start (will auto launch on localhost:8080)<br />

Have fun with React!
